            <p>TV sitcoms come and go. A few linger on for some time. Others have some memorable dialogues. Some remain popular for their high ratings and horde of trophies while the rest boast of a formidable cast. Among this far-spread out sea of The Big Bang Theories, How I Met Your Mothers and Modern Families, one tiny water droplet shines and stands out. Yes, I am talking about F.R.I.E.N.D.S. The insanely hit 90's show of the highly competent duo of David Crane and Marta Kauffman starring the supremely talented David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc.

                <br><br>Friends is much more than an insanely hit TV show. It is the balm for all worries, the stress-buster after a tension-infused day, a sublime treat for everyday achievements, an exceedingly satisfying break from a rigorous study routine and last but not the least, this epic sitcom is your confidante, your consoling shoulder and an integral part of your life.
                
                <br><br>2 decades since its first episode was aired, and you can still relate to it. Over 200 episodes and not even one that’ll let your attention falter! Most importantly, the friends themselves. If you have your doubts about friends becoming family, this gang will surely clear them all. Each of them has something to teach you. Monica taught us perfection and perseverance (I can almost hear her shout “I Know!”). Rachel taught us that even if you’re spoilt and rotten, you still have hope. Phoebe taught us to never be afraid of new experiences and to never let circumstances, inclusive of a drug addict mother, bog you down. Ross taught us to be caring, kind, nerdy. He also dropped off a few essential tips on parenting and marriage. (:P) You never have to grow up. Don’t ever give up on your dreams, even if it is that of becoming a star. All this and loyalty, that’s what Joey taught us. Not to forget, his evergreen pickup line. (I’m doin fine Joey, thank you ) Chandler Bing. A responsible and caring man hidden under all those sarcastic one liners and jokes. A loving, loyal and supportive husband. Could he BE any better?
                
                <br><br>If you have watched Friends, there is no doubt that these 6 people have carved a permanent place in your heart. At every moment, you are reminded of them. You feel content knowing they are there for you always and how despite being just fictional characters, you connect with them as if they are real.
                
                <br><br>So don't watch FRIENDS so that you don't get mocked by your friends who have already watched FRIENDS. Watch it because no matter how low you are feeling at any point in your life, no matter anyone is there for you or not,FRIENDS will always "be there for you"! :D Friends is not a sitcom, it's a goddamn experience!</p>
