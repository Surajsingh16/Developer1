            <h1>F.R.I.E.N.D.S BLOG</h1>
            <p>MAY-21 <br>TV sitcoms come and go. A few linger on for some time. Others have some memorable dialogues. Some remain popular for their high ratings and horde of trophies while the rest boast of a formidable cast. Among this far-spread out sea of The Big Bang Theories, How I Met Your Mothers and Modern Families, one tiny water droplet shines and stands out. Yes, I am talking about F.R.I.E.N.D.S. The insanely hit 90's show of the highly competent duo of David Crane and Marta Kauffman starring the supremely talented David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc.</p>

        <h1>DARK BLOG</h1>
        <p>MAY-21 <br>Yesterday. today and tomorrow are not consecutive, they are connected in never ending circle. Everything is connected.<br><br>
            Dark is a German Sci-fi thriller released in December on Netflix. Its one of the best TV series showing the concept of time travel without creating new timelines. This blog post is for those who have watched the TV series and are wondering what just happened in the last episode. There are many questions which need to be answered like why Michael commits suicide in June, when he was coexisting with Mikkel for 11 years, and why 5 months before Mikkel’s disappearance? How he writes the exact date on the letter? Why the stranger dosen’t open the door of the bunker where Jonas was trapped? And many more. Questions like this will be answered in this post. So obviously there are massive spoilers ahead. Please watch the TV series before reading this post.
